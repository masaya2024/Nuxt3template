# Nuxt 4 + Tailwind Starter

This project is a Nuxt 4 SSR template that ships with the official Tailwind CSS module pre-configured (including a sample landing view in `app/app.vue`).

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) and the [Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) to learn more.

```bash
# npm
npm install

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

## Styling

- Global Tailwind styles live in `app/assets/css/tailwind.css`.
